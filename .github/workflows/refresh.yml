# Auto-refresh miriad-core skill on all Miriad instances.
#
# On push to main, curls the /skills/refresh endpoint to trigger
# a re-import of the skill from this repo. The endpoint calls the
# existing importSkill() function which fetches the latest SKILL.md
# and reference files from git.
#
# The endpoint is unauthenticated — it only accepts known source URLs
# and the import is idempotent (overwrites existing skill files).
